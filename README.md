# StudentDirectory
A program that manages the registration of students at the institution
I use the SearchTree class to store the list of students.

The SearchTree class inherits from Tree class, the Tree class allows me to store the students with a lexicographic classification and to ease the handling of the data.

At each iteration, the program displays a menu and reads in a request (a-e) from the user to be executed. The program terminates when an e, which marks the end of the program, is read. 

The menu:

a.	add a student

b.	delete a student

c.	search for a student

d.	print in lexicographic order the names of all registered students.

e.	exit
